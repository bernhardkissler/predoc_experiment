                    Before you continue please make sure you answered these questions correctly, as <strong> incorrect
                        answers will result in your being disqualified </strong> for the rest of this experiment. This
                    means if you answer incorrectly, you won't answer any further questions and you won't receive any

                        anything of which you are certain. </strong> It is merely meant focus your attention.
