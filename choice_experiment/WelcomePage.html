<p>
    Dear Participant,
    <br><br>
    we want to thank you for answering our questions in this experiment. Your answers are essential for us to
    produce great research and it is extremely important that you take the time to read through all
    instructions carefully and do your best in answering our questions accurately and honestly.
    <br><br>
    During this experiment you can win a significant bonus (up to $20). This bonus is determined by a
    combination of your choices and the random resolution of risks. This will be explained in more detail on the next
    screen.
    <br><br>
    You can expect to spend roughly 30 minutes on these tasks although this can vary somewhat depending on how quickly
    you move on on each screen. There is however no hard time-limit for how long you may take overall.
    <br><br>
    Sincerely,
    <br>
    the Experimenters

    <strong>Notes:</strong> <br>
    Usually, I would also ask for ProlificIDs on this screen as well as provide some explanation about privacy issues
    and show contact data.
