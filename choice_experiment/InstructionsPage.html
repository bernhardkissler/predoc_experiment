<p>
    During the experiment you will make two types of choices. For each choice you will presented with a risky option A
    and a certain option B and be asked which one you prefer. In the end of the experiment, we will randomly select one
    of the choices you made to calculate your payoff. That means any of your choices could determine you payoff and you
    should think about any single one of them carefully.
</p>
<p>
    The risky options will always take the form of a so called lottery. In this experiment, the lotteries will always
    present two options, one offering a high bonus and one offering a low bonus:

</p>
<p class="text-center">
    With probability <strong>45%:</strong> Get <strong>$19</strong> <br>
    With probability <strong>55%:</strong> Get <strong>$6</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If at the end of the experiment a round is selected to determine your payoff in which you chose the risky option A,
    this risky option itself is also resolved randomly.
</p>
<p>
    While the risky options will always look the same, there are two different ways we will present the certain options.
    The first three choices you make will present the certain options similarly to the lotteries and your choice will
    look like this:
</p>
<div id="decision_table">
    <table class="table table-bordered border-secondary">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td class="text-center align-middle">
                    <strong>
                        Option A
                    </strong>
                </td>
                <td class="text-center align-middle">
                    <strong>
                        Option B
                    </strong>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td style="width: 50%;" class="text-center align-middle">
                    With probability <strong>70%</strong>: Get <strong>$20</strong>
                    <br>
                    With probability <strong>30%</strong>: Get <strong>$0</strong>
                </td>
                <td style="width: 50%;" class="text-center align-middle">
                    Get <strong>$8</strong> for certain (100%)
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        In these rounds, you will simply be asked which of the two options you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the last (4<sup>th</sup>) choice, the certain option will be presented as a list. You will then be
        asked to indicate for each row whether you prefer the risky option A on the left or the certain option B on the
        right. You indicate your preferences by clicking either on the left button or the right one. The bottom most row
        gives you instant feedback on how we interpret your inputs. <br>
        The list below is not connected to any of your choices. Feel free to play around with it to get a feeling for
        the way it works.
